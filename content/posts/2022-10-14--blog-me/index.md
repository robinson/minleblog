This is not the first time I write the blog. I started with yahoo 360 more than 15 years ago, then I changed to WordPress, sometimes I wrote in facebook notes, I also tried with GitHub pages (Jekyll) as well. But this time I try with something nerd and techie, I would say that :thumbsup: :smile: :sparkler: I will explain why this blog was born as following.

Sometimes I was wandering on the internet. When I was a student in the University, I used to stay up late, until a - I discovered what I need or b - I was tired and stop (the case (b) normally happened), for reading on the internet. At that time, Wikipedia or Google was not existed, I surfed from web to web, yahoo pages to many forums, to read, and try to understand something. For instance, once I tried to read something about military history and in the end I finished with a German poem :-) and that I called the "spread of web links". 
This time is not an exceptional, I tried to understand what is web 3.0, and now...I build a blog. The route was: web 3.0 -> blog -> static web -> azure static web -> Gatsby -> template open source of gatsby...so on. I wander from these links to other links. It made me more exciting and that's why I am writing this.

I have no idea know how far I can go with this blog, or it would be dropped such as any blogs of mine before, or even lost the motivation. Nevertheless I will try to keep this blog as long as I can, and share anything I collected, about any aspects, technologies, software development and architecture, poem, politics, pictures, so called "lock, stock, and barrel". My motto have been "sharing is caring", by following by this way or other way, with more public or limit in a small group.

In this blog, I used:
- Gatsby blog from https://github.com/baobabKoodaa/blog 
- Instagram module from https://github.com/oorestisime/gatsby-source-instagram. 
- I hosted in azure static web apps (free), 
- build it in CI/CD with GitHub actions. 

Perhaps you can find out thousand of blog or artical how to using Gatsby with azure static web apps and Github, I won't mention about it. The most effort I spend for this blog i
