This is not the first time I write the blog. I started with yahoo 360 more than 15 years ago, then I changed to wordpress, then sometimes I wrote in facebook notes, I also tried with github pages (Jekyll). But this time I try with something nerd, I would say :thumbsup: :smile: :sparkler: I will explain why this blog was born.

Sometimes I was wandering in the internet. When I was a student in the University, I stay up late many night, until a - I discovered what I need or b - I was tired and stop (the case (b) normally happened), for wandering in the internet. At that time, wikipedia or google was not existed, I wander from web to web, yahoo pages, to many many forum, to read, and try to understand something. For instance, once I tried to read something about military history and in the end I finished with german poem :-) and that I called the "spread of web links". 
This time is not an exceptional, I wanted to understand what is web 3.0 and now I build a blog. The route is: web 3.0 -> blog -> static web -> azure static web -> gatsby -> template opensource of gatsby...so on. I wander from this links to other links. It made me more exciting and that's why I am writing this.

I do not know how far I can go with this blog, or it should be drop like any blogs of mine before, or lost the motivation to share, who know. I will try to keep it as long as I can, and share anything I collected, about many aspects, technologies, software development, software architecture, poem, politics, pictures, "lock, stock, and barrel". My motto is "sharing is caring", I am following this by this way or other way, with more public or limit in a small group. I identify myself as a self-taught person, and absolutely without billion of knowledge sharing out there, I could not become what I am right now. "Share to receive more deserving".

In this blog, I used Gatsby blog from https://github.com/baobabKoodaa/blog, with instagram module from https://github.com/oorestisime/gatsby-source-instagram. I hosted in azure static web, build it in CI/CD with github actions. Those are all the ingredients to cook this dish.
