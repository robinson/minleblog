I am not novice in the cybersecurity domain, nor software security area, but the first time I heard about security by design(SbD) was just last year. It seems a "buzzword" and has been using everywhere, and people talk about it, quote about it (even the quoter about SbD had no idea what it is). 
Nowaday, the cybersecurity becomes a hot topic everywhere. In the era of digital transformation or industry 4.0 waves, it becomes more and more critical.
